# Predictive Maintenance Project

## Overview

This project is designed to develop a predictive maintenance system that uses historical sensor data from industrial equipment to predict equipment failures. The goal is to reduce downtime and maintenance costs by predicting when equipment is likely to fail.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: You need Git for version control. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **DVC**: Data Version Control tool. Install it using `pip install dvc`.
- **Docker**: To run Docker containers. Follow the instructions at [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **AWS CLI**: To interact with AWS services. Install it from [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/predictive_maintenance.git
cd predictive_maintenance
```

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# src/data_ingestion.py

def get_db_connection(): # Replace with your AWS RDS credentials
engine = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@rds_endpoint:port/dbname')
return engine.connect()

# Fetch raw data from AWS RDS

python src/data_ingestion.py

# Clean the data using SQL scripts

python src/clean_data.py

# Generate features using SQL scripts

python src/feature_engineering.py

python src/train_model.py

# Build Docker image

docker build -t predictive-maintenance-app .

# Run Docker container

docker run -p 5000:5000 predictive-maintenance-app

# Add data files to DVC

dvc add data/raw/sensor_data.csv
dvc add data/processed/sensor_features.csv

# Commit changes

git add data/raw/sensor_data.csv.dvc data/processed/sensor_features.csv.dvc
git commit -m "Add raw and processed data with DVC"

# Configure DVC remote (example with S3)

dvc remote add -d myremote s3://mybucket/dvcstore
dvc push
mlflow ui

### Instructions for Running the Project Locally

This `README.md` provides a detailed guide on how to set up and run the project locally, from initializing the environment to deploying the model using Docker. It also includes steps for data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, training the model, version controlling with DVC, and tracking experiments with MLflow.

Feel free to customize the `README.md` file with any specific details or adjustments based on your project's needs!
